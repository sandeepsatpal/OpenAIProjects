# AI/OpenAI/Azure OpenAI Sample codebase

In an era defined by intelligent systems and data-driven decisions, OpenAI's technologies offer a transformative lens. This project explores sample code for the most required methods to integrate AI models for your websites. In this projects, you can find sample modules on, how to integrate your code with OpenAI APIs. 
Apart from itnegration, you can also explore fine tuning and RAG approach to customize AI for your own requirements and data. 
This projects gives you glimpse of all the state of the art and latest methodologies utilizing OpenAI (like openAI, Azure AI foundary, open source Langchain).

<h2>ðŸ¤– Quick Comparison: OpenAI API vs Azure OpenAI vs LangChain Framework</h2>

      <td><strong>Cost</strong></td>
      <td>Pay-per-token pricing from OpenAI</td>
      <td>Azure pricing + OpenAI usage</td>
      <td>LangChain is free; costs depend on underlying LLM (e.g., OpenAI)</td>

      <td><strong>Security & Compliance</strong></td>
      <td>Standard API key security</td>
      <td>Enterprise-grade security (AAD, GDPR, HIPAA)</td>
